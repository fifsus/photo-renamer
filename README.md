## Installation of PyInstaller
This is not required, already part of the code. Keeping it just for my own sake.

Install PyInstaller from PyPI:

pip install pyinstaller

`poetry add pyinstaller`

Go to your programâ€™s directory and run:

pyinstaller -F src/photo_renamer/__main__.py

This will generate the bundle in a subdirectory called dist.

pyinstaller -F yourprogram.py
Adding -F (or --onefile) parameter will pack everything into single "exe".

pyinstaller -F --paths=<your_path>\Lib\site-packages  yourprogram.py
running into "ImportError" you might consider side-packages.

 pip install pynput==1.6.8
still runing in Import-Erorr - try to downgrade pyinstaller - see Getting error when using pynput with pyinstaller
